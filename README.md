#### Report

##### Introduction

We were asked with developing a model to forecast the values of used automobiles for a group of used automobile retailers. Our objective was to determine the primary determinants of used automobile pricing in order to offer dealers with valuable information.

##### Methodology

We started by investigating and cleaning the dataset. We eliminated null values and columns that did not contribute to our analysis. Afterwards, we did exploratory data analysis to detect any patterns or correlations in the data.

Following this, we constructed multiple regression models using various techniques, including linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and gridsearch. Using MSE, R2 scores and feature significance ratings, we determined the performance of each model.

##### Findings
Our investigation found that the year of the vehicle, the mileage (odometer), the average price of the brand, the number of cylinders, and the type of fuel are the most important determinants of used car costs. With an R2 value of 0.56, our decision tree regression model scored the best, explaining 56% of the data's variance.

##### Recommendations

Based on our results, we advise used car dealers to pay great attention to the age and mileage of the vehicles they acquire and sell. They should also evaluate the typical cost of the brand they are dealing with, the number of cylinders, and the gasoline type. These variables may have a substantial effect on the price of a used automobile.

##### Conclusion
In summary, our approach gives important insight into the determinants of used-car pricing. We think that used vehicle sellers may utilize this information to fine-tune their inventories and boost their sales.
